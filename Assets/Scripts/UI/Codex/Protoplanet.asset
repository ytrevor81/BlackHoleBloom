  <Description>k__BackingField: '- Protoplanets are planetary embryos formed within
    protoplanetary disks. They originate as moon-sized bodies within the dense gas
    and dust disks surrounding young stars, and over time can evolve into full-fledged
    planets.


    - Protoplanets undergo internal melting and differentiation. As
    they accumulate more mass, their interiors can heat up, causing heavier materials
    (like metals) to sink and lighter ones to rise, creating layered structures.


    -
    They are often found in stellar nurseries like nebulae.'
