  <Description>k__BackingField: "- Dwarf planets orbit sround their local star and
    are nearly round, but don\u2019t dominate their orbits. According to the International
    Astronomical Union (IAU), dwarf planets must orbit a star and be massive enough
    for gravity to shape them into a round form, but they haven\u2019t cleared their
    orbital path of other debris.\n\n- Five are officially recognized in our Solar
    System. These are Ceres, Pluto, Haumea, Makemake, and Eris"
