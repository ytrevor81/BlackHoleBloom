  <Description>k__BackingField: "- T Tauri stars are very young, pre\u2011main\u2011sequence
    stars\u2014often less than about 10 million years old\u2014representing a transitional
    stage between protostars and mature main-sequence stars. They\u2019re still contracting
    and powered by gravitational energy, not nuclear fusion.\n\n- These young stars
    exhibit irregular fluctuations in brightness and strong emission lines. Many
    show intense magnetic activity\u2014bright in X-rays and radio\u2014up to 1,000
    times more energetic than our Sun, with powerful stellar winds and eruptions.\n\n-
    Roughly half of T Tauri stars are surrounded by protoplanetary disks\u2014crucial
    birthplaces of planets.\n\n- T Tauri stars typically form deep within dusty molecular
    clouds and nebulae."
