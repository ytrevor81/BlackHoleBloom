  <Description>k__BackingField: "- Helium is the second most abundant element in
    the universe. It makes up about 24% of the universe\u2019s mass, second only
    to hydrogen. \n\n- Helium was first discovered in the Sun before it was found
    on Earth. A yellow spectral line observed during a solar eclipse in 1868 led
    to its detection\u2014hence the name from Greek Helios (sun). Its presence on
    Earth wasn\u2019t confirmed until decades later. \n\n- Nebulae are composed primarily
    of hydrogen and helium. \n\n- Helium in nebulae often originates from dying stars.
    Many nebulae are the aftermath of supernovae, expelling helium produced in the
    star\u2019s core."
