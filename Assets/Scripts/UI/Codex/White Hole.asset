  <Description>k__BackingField: "- White holes are purely theoretical\u2014opposite
    of black holes. According to general relativity, white holes are regions of spacetime
    that cannot be entered from the outside but from which matter, energy, and light
    can emerge\u2014making them the time-reversed counterpart of black holes.\n\n-
    They likely violate physical laws and are unstable. White holes defy the second
    law of thermodynamics\u2014since spontaneous ejection of matter would decrease
    entropy. Additionally, any attempt to form or perturb a white hole would likely
    cause it to collapse into a black hole."
