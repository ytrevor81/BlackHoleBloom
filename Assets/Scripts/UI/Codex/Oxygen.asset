  <Description>k__BackingField: "- Oxygen is the third most abundant element in the
    universe, coming right after hydrogen and helium.\n\n- Liquid and solid oxygen
    exhibit a pale blue color and are strongly magnetic, due to its unique physical
    properties. It is a violet color in this game only due to creative liberty.\n\n-
    Oxygen is essential for most multicellular life, serving as a highly efficient
    terminal electron acceptor in cellular respiration and enabling life to extract
    energy from food.\n\n- In certain planetary nebulae, doubly ionized oxygen (O\u202FIII)
    gives rise to a striking blue-green glow, creating vivid and iconic nebular visuals."
