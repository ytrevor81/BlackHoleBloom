  <Description>k__BackingField: "- Protostars are contracting masses of gas which
    represents an early stage in the formation of a star, before nucleosynthesis
    has begun.\n\n- Protostars glow not from fusion, but from gravitational contraction.
    At this early stage, their luminosity is generated by the heat released as the
    gas and dust collapse inward\u2014not yet by nuclear fusion.\n\n- They begin
    their lives embedded deep within nebulae.\n\n- The largest known protostar is
    located about 9,100 light-years away in the Cepheus constellation, and it's roughtly
    300 times the size of our solar system."
