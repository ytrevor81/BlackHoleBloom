  <Description>k__BackingField: "- Carbonaceous chondrites constitute only about
    4\u20135\u202F% of all observed meteorite falls, and they remain largely unaltered
    since their formation.\n\n- Embedded within these chondrites are presolar grains,
    which are tiny particles that predate our solar system.\n\n- The Winchcombe meteorite\u2014a
    well-preserved carbonaceous chondrite that fell in the UK in 2021\u2014bears
    hydrogen and oxygen isotopic signatures that closely match those found in Earth's
    oceans. This strengthens the theory that water-rich carbonaceous asteroids contributed
    significantly to Earth\u2019s oceans."
