  <Description>k__BackingField: "- Silicates are a key component of cosmic dust in
    nebulae. Interstellar dust often contains silicate materials\u2014compounds of
    silicon and oxygen (collectively referred to as \"silicates\")\u2014which play
    a vital role in cooling astrophysical gas and enabling star formation in nebulae.\n\n-
    Silica dust can form clusters that contribute to planet formation.\n\n- Silica
    (SiO\u2082) is abundant in the Earth\u2019s crust. Found in forms like quartz,
    sand, and many types of rock, silica is one of Earth's most common minerals.\n\n-
    Silicate dust grains in nebulae often act as chemical reaction sites. In dense,
    cold nebular environments, silicate dust grains become coated with icy mantles
    (such as water, methane, and ammonia), creating surfaces where complex organic
    molecules can form.\n\n- Silica in protoplanetary disks often exists in high-temperature
    crystal forms."
